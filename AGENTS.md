# Agent Guidelines

## Scope
These guidelines apply to the entire `HomeAI` repository unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` file is added deeper in the tree.

## Development Workflow
- Prefer small, focused commits that include any necessary documentation updates.
- When running tests, favor `pytest` for project-wide validation (`pytest -q`).
- Update this file if additional recurring project conventions or workflows emerge during future tasks.

## Documentation
- Keep repository-level documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/`) consistent with code changes when relevant.
- Record any new developer tips or common gotchas here to help future iterations.

## PR / Summary Notes
- Summaries should be concise bullet lists covering the main code or documentation changes.
- Note all tests or checks that were run, including commands executed.
